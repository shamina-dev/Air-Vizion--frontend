                Air pollution is a serious health risk, particularly for children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing conditions.
                 Exposure to pollutants like particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone can lead to respiratory
                  issues, cardiovascular diseases, and aggravate asthma.</p>

          During high pollution levels, itâ€™s important to limit outdoor exposure, wear 
          protective masks, and use air purifiers indoors. Vulnerable individuals should stay indoors as much a
          s possible and seek regular health check-ups to manage the impact of pollution.
